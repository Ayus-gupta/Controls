# Inner Choice 🧠⚔️

## Main Motive of This App

This app is **very simple by design** —  
but its **intention is strong**.

There are no complex features, no analytics, no tricks.  
Because the truth about distraction is simple —  
We just avoid looking at it.

This app exists for people who are **deeply self-aware**,  
those who strongly observe their own actions and genuinely want to understand:

> **Who really controls me — Man 1 or Man 2?**

This is not a productivity app.  
This is a **mirror**.

Every action logged here already happened.  
You don’t plan — you **accept**.

## The Core Idea

Inside every human, there are **two opposing forces**:

---

### 🟢 Man 1 — The Builder (Hero)

- Represents discipline, clarity, and long-term strength  
- Encourages work, focus, and growth  
- Chooses discomfort today for freedom tomorrow  
- Grows stronger every time you work

**Man 1 asks:**  
> “Will this make me stronger in the long run?”

---

### 🔴 Man 2 — The Comfort Seeker (Villain)

- Represents distraction, excuses, and instant pleasure  
- Always has a convincing reason  
- Makes delay feel harmless  
- Grows stronger with every distraction

**Man 2 whispers:**  
> “It’s okay… just this once.”

---

## How the App Works

- If you worked → 🟢 Man 1 grows  
- If you got distracted → 🔴 Man 2 grows  
- When one grows, the other shrinks  
- Over time, size reveals **who dominates your behavior**

No limits.  
No hiding.  
So that you know – only what you repeatedly choose.

## Why It’s Simple

Because **self-control is not complex** —  
we just complicate it to escape responsibility.

The UI is minimal.  
The logic is direct.  
The intention is strong.

This app doesn’t motivate you.  
It **exposes you**.

## Who Is This App For?

✅ People who value self-honesty  
✅ Those who observe their own habits  
✅ Builders, learners, and thinkers  
❌ Not for shortcut seekers  
❌ Not for fake motivation

If you are willing to see the truth —  
this app will show it.

## Final Thought

You already know what to do.

The only question left is:

> **Who did you listen to today?**
